# **The Best All-in-One WordPress Plugin for Popups, Website Personalization, and A/B Testing**
If you're looking to boost sales, grow your email subscribers, and drive business growth, Personizely is the ultimate conversion marketing toolkit for you. This powerful platform helps you convert website visitors who are about to leave into subscribers and prospective customers. With Personizely, you can easily create personalized email subscription prompts, popup forms, sticky announcement bars, opt-in forms, and a wide variety of interactive popups. Best of all, setup takes just minutes, not hours!

Unlike typical WordPress plugins, Personizely puts user experience front and center. Its smart targeting and personalization features ensure you show the right popup to the right user at the perfect moment, tailoring the experience to your unique needs.

With Popup A/B Testing, you can experiment with different popup designs, messages, and calls to action, refining your approach to maximize conversions. URL A/B Testing allows you to test variations of specific landing pages based on URL, helping you pinpoint which version drives the most engagement and sales. Additionally, Content A/B Testing lets you test different content elements—whether it’s headlines, images, or calls-to-action—so you can understand exactly what your audience responds to most effectively.

Personizely’s popups and opt-in forms are fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices—whether visitors are using desktops, laptops, tablets, or smartphones. Optimized for performance, conversion, SEO, and marketing, Personizely removes the complexity from creating personalized popup forms.

Smart business owners, developers, and designers love Personizely for its simplicity and effectiveness. Here’s why:


# **Drag & Drop Popup Builder**
We are over the slow and bloated popup maker plugins, and we know you are too. We built Personizely to be adaptable to let you create custom popups, newsletter opt-ins, announcement bars, and slide-in popups, as well as high-conversion lead generating forms quickly. This will be an essential tool for enhancing your marketing workflow.
With your drag & drop popup builder, you can control and customize easily the expression and feel of your opt-in popups. You can even add countdowns, surveys, and other dynamic popups that are suited to the behavior of the user.

# **Pre-Built Popup Templates For Conversion Increase**
So why is it that building marketing popups that generate high conversions takes so much time? Mostly it’s because other plugins require you to build the popup from scratch, something that, unless you really want to, you do not actually need to do.
If you are looking to create a free shipping bar, newsletter popup, announcement bar with (or without) a countdown, a slide-in popup, coupon popup, newsletter popup, or any other advanced popup model, Personizely has a template in place to help you start beyond the proverbial ‘start line’ inside the easy popup builder.
Personizely is stocked with dozens of templates to help you create popups faster. Check out our gallery for all the options you have.


# **Onsite Retargeting And Popups For New Visitors**
The number of visitors who leave your site never to return is at a staggering 70%. Personizely can help you prevent them all from being ‘lost’ by leveraging the strategy of employing exit-intent popups. Instead, it can convert a lot of them into subscribers, and potentially, paying customers.
At the moment, if a user is intending to leave your site, they can be presented with exit-intent popups, a strategy that helps convert an additional 4% – 6% of your site’s visitors. On top of that, exit-intent popups can be utilized to show different popup messages to visitors who have returned to your site vs those who are new.
These go a long way in reducing cart abandonment, saving you money on retargeting ads and pay-per-click advertisements.


# **Behavior-Based Personalization And Advanced Targeting**
Personizely allows you to highly customize your popups for users based on an advanced range of factors including (but not limited to) the visitor’s geographic location, when they click on a specific link, or based on a historical analysis of their past popup clicking behaviors.
Whether a user had seen another popup in a different marketing campaign, previously clicked on a marketing popup, viewed a particular number of pages, or closed a particular marketing popup in the past – can help drill down to the type of popup that is most effective for converting this particular visitor into a subscriber or a customer, helping you improve your lead generation efforts and grow your sales.


# **Email Marketing Integration, Popup A/B Testing, And Popup Analytics**
Personizely does not slow down your site as it employs its advanced popup algorithms to help you grow your site and business as many other popup tools tend to do. That is because unlike other plugins, Personizely does not employ wp-ajax for popup analytics setup and slow down your site due to the cache settings. On top of that, caching plugins are inherently skewing the data in typical popup plugins.
Personizely addressed both of those concerns with a superior popup generation infrastructure, allowing you to employ A/B popup testing that is reliable. This also allows for accurate data returned during conversion analytics and email marketing and CRM integrations are made seamless.
